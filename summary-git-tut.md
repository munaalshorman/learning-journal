## what is git
*it's a version control system that saves all data in a file system .relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources. so all history of project can be found in local disk.
Git will always detect file corruption or loss of information in transit.Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.*

*commit :the prossess each time you saved a changed version of  your project*

### States ###
*Git can reside in three main states:*
1.  committed: Data is securely stored in a local database
2. modified :File has been changed but not committed to the database
3. staged:Flagged a fileâ€™s changed version to be committed in the next snapshot.
